Welcome to the official Neo blog! Neo is a dynamic scripting/programming language that I (sci4me) have been working on since May 28, 2017. In that short time, I have made more progress on this project than I could have ever expected to. As of now, Neo is a mostly complete programming language and can be used to write working software.

The language, however, is still very early in its development. Language constructs are being added, removed, and changed very rapidly; for example, I added an entirely new language construct today: here strings (a handy feature to have).

Neo is implemented with a virtual machine called N4 written in C#. I intend to release this as open-source software on GitHub as soon as possible; hopefully in July, 2017.  
However, I fully intend to rewrite Neo from scratch in [Jai](https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888/videos?view=0&live_view=500&flow=grid&sort=dd) as soon as it is released. I **do not** intend to maintain compatability between the C# version and the Jai version; nor do I intend to maintain the C# version. Therefore, for that reason, among others, this software should not be used in production.
The Jai version of Neo will hopefully be production-ready eventually.

For now, Neo itself is closed-source. This is just because I do not intend to release it until it is really ready for release. Thus, it is conceivable that the initial release would be delayed past July; however, I do want to release it as soon as possible, so, we shall see. I will continue to post updates as applicable.

For now, these are the open-source projects on the Neo [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/neo-lang):
 * [sublime-syntax](https://github.com/neo-lang/sublime-syntax) - The Sublime Text 3 syntax highlighter for Neo source code
 * [neo-lang.github.io](https://github.com/neo-lang/neo-lang.github.io) - This website
 * [cloc](https://github.com/neo-lang/cloc) - A fork of [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) that adds support for Neo (I will be submitting a pull request to merge Neo support into cloc's master branch after Neo itself is released)

The progress I have made on this project thus far is incredibly encouraging. I am incredibly excited to keep working and eventually release Neo on GitHub. The rest of 2017 will be quite interesting for Neo and I look forward making it successful.
